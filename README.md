yo-mean-pass
============

Yo-MEAN-Pass is an attempt to bring the MEAN stack into Yeoman. This is not based on the yo generator `angular-fullstack`, but using the yo generator `angular` with [mean](https://github.com/linnovate/mean) 

## [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) ##

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is an open source client-side development stack, consisting of tools and frameworks intended to help developers quickly build high quality web applications. Yeoman runs as a command-line interface written in Node.js which combines several functions into one place, such as generating a starter template, managing dependencies, running unit tests, providing a local development server, and optimizing production code for deployment.

## [MEAN](http://www.mean.io/#!/) ##

MEAN stack is the acronym which stands for: (M)ongoDB – a noSQL document datastore which uses JSON-style documents to represent data, (E)xpress – a HTTP server framework on top of Node, (A)ngular – as you know, the JS framework offering declarative, two-way databinding for webapps and (N)ode – the platform built on V8’s runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
